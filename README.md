# cruise-ships

This is my cruise ships project where I will be using Object Oriented Programming.
This project was created to practice passing objects into another, assigning methods and properties for objects and isolating objects in tests.

Programming Language used: Javascript


Concepts I tried to focus on:
-Domain Modelling
-Object-oriented Programming
-Single Responsibility Principle
-Dependency inversion
-Mocks
-Spies

Instructions:
Npm install (ensuring Jest is a dev dependency )

TO DO LIST:
see cruise-ships-gui which is a continuation of this project. This project needs to be completed with 
-addition of a message box
-the ports to be rendered on the screen
-and a box to add a port name
